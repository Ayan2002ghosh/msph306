        "Now that we have seen variables at work, it's time to delve into a slightly more advanced feature of python, its **idiomatic nature**.\n",
        "\n",
        "The key characteristic of python is ***readability***. It is of great importance that we leverage on readability, since code is read much more often than it is written. The design of python programs is heavily influenced by the following principles, often called the **\"Zen of Python\"**\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Beautiful is better than ugly.\n",
        "2. Explicit is better than implicit.\n",
        "3. Simple is better than complex.\n",
        "4. Readability counts.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "There are some other principles (19 in total), but these four are the key ones.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Extra:** If you want to see all Zen principles, run the python command `import this`.\n",
        "\n",
        "Very broadly, these mean that there should be semantically **simple** and **easy-to-understand** ways to do \"standard tasks\" that are required by computer programmers, even if the actual task is logically very complex.\n",
        "\n",
        "These 'simple' ways of doing 'complex' tasks are called **idioms**.\n",
        "\n",
        "Thus, an idiom in python is similar to an idiom in English (বাগ্ধারা in Bengali), where a short, pithy phrase is stated to mean something completely different than the literal description: For example, the Bengali বাগ্ধারা \"ঘোড়ার ডিম\" (idiom \"horse's egg\") which stands for something that does not exist, or is unlikely, impossible, or absurd. This type of idiom is called an idiom of improbability, or 'adynaton', and it is similar to the idiom \"when pigs fly\" in English, or \"Am Sankt-Nimmerleins-Tag\" (on Saint-Never's-day) in German.\n",
        "\n",
        "Python has many idioms that make complex programming easy. Let us look at an example. Suppose you have two variables\n",
