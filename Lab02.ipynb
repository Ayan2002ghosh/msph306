    "\n",
    "## Variables and Keywords\n",
    "\n",
    "The most fundamental named entity in Python is an **identifier**, which is essentially a name for something. A Python identifier is used to name a variable, function, class, module, or any other Python object.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two types of identifiers: Variables and Keywords.\n",
    "\n",
    "Keywords are predefined identifiers in Python. There are 33 keywords in Python, each with a specific meaning.\n",

    "\n",
    "For example,\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "True, False\n",
    "```\n",
    "are keywords for Boolean expressions. `True` corresponds to the logic bit 1 and `False` to the bit 0. Similarly,\n",
    "```\n",
    "and, or, not\n",
    "```\n",
    "are logical operator keywords. Additionally, `None` represents a null Python object, similar to the null set in set theory. We will explore the usage of some of these keywords throughout this course. The key point is that **these keywords are reserved**, meaning you cannot use them as variable names.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, let’s discuss variables. Variables are names that refer to data. Essentially, they are a way to reference data created by your program in memory. For instance, a Python statement like\n",
    "```python\n",
    "log_one = 0\n",
    "```\n",
    "when executed, causes Python to perform the following actions:\n",
    "1. Create the data, which is an integer with value `0`, and store it in computer memory. \n",
    "2. Create a variable named `log_one` and associate it with the previously created data. \n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, this data is **referenced** by the variable log_one. This reference allows you to access and manipulate the data using the variable name.\n",
    "\n",
    "This reference and its associated data will remain preserved throughout the execution of the program, unless you change the reference, the data that was referenced, or delete the variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "Data can also be **unreferenced**, that is to say, not be associated with any variable. For instance, the python statement\n",
    "```python\n",
    "print(23.5)\n",
    "```\n",
    "when executed, causes Python to perform the following actions:\n",
    "1. Create the data, which is an integer with value `23.5`, and store it in computer memory.\n",
    "2. Pass that data to the `print()` function and display the output\n",
    "\n",
    "Note, however, that no variable was involved. This means that the created data is unreferenced. Python has a **garbage collector** that deletes unreferenced data from memory as it runs through the program. \n",
    "\n",
    "You can delete a variable or re-reference it, for instance\n",
    "```python\n",
    "a = 5\n",
    "b = 10\n",
    "\n",
    "...\n",
    "...\n",
    "\n",
    "del(a)\n",
    "b = 25\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "Let us look at this piece of code carefully.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. In the first line, the integer `5` was prepared in memory and referenced by the variable named `a`.\n",
    "    * Therefore, this data is in a referenced state.\n",
    "2. In the penultimate line, the variable `a` is **deleted** with the `del()` function. \n",
    "    * Note that this `del` is a keyword from the table above! \n",
    "    * This is a built-in function that, when executed, deletes the variable in its argument. In this case, that is `a`.\n",
    "    * Now, the associated data (the integer `5`) has been ***de-referenced*** to an unreferenced state.\n",
    "    * This unreferenced data will be erased from computer memory later. \n",
    "3. In the second line, the integer `10` was prepared in memory and referenced by the variable named `b`. \n",
    "    * Therefore, this data is also in a referenced state.\n",
    "4. However, in the last line, `b` was ***re-referenced*** to newly created data , namely, the integer `25`.\n",
    "    * So the old data (the integer `10`) is now in an unreferenced state.\n",
    "    * This data will **also** be erased from computer memory later. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Rules for creating variables:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Must start with alphabet or an underscore.\n",
    "* Followed by zero or more letters, _ , and digits.\n",
    "* A keyword cannot be used as identifier.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Usage of variables\n",
    "\n",
    "Variables can be used in two ways:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. As arguments to functions or declarations. For instance, the example above:\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "    del(a)\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "   where we supplied the variable `a` as an argument to the `del()` function.\n",
    "2. As **operands** to **operators** in an expression. For instance, the expression \n",
    "    ```python\n",
    "        a = b + c\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "    where the `+` operator is executed with the variables `b` and `c` as operands. The evaluated value (assuming that `b` and `c` are referenced to numbers, then the value is simply their sum) is referenced by the variable `a`. \n",
    "    \n",
    "Let us now try an example code\n",
    "\n"

    "\n",
    "Now that we have seen variables at work, it's time to delve into a slightly more advanced feature of python, its **idiomatic nature**. \n",
    "\n",
    "The key characteristic of python is ***readability***. It is of great importance that we leverage on readability, since code is read much more often than it is written. The design of python programs is heavily influenced by the following principles, often called the **\"Zen of Python\"**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Beautiful is better than ugly.\n",
    "2. Explicit is better than implicit.\n",
    "3. Simple is better than complex.\n",
    "4. Readability counts.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are some other principles (19 in total), but these four are the key ones. \n",
    "\n",
    "Very broadly, these mean that there should be semantically **simple** and **easy-to-understand** ways to do \"standard tasks\" that are required by computer programmers, even if the actual task is logically very complex. \n",
    "\n",
    "These 'simple' ways of doing 'complex' tasks are called **idioms**. \n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, an idiom in python is similar to an idiom in English (বাগ্ধারা in Bengali), where a short, pithy phrase is stated to mean something completely different than the literal description: For example, the Bengali বাগ্ধারা \"ঘোড়ার ডিম\" (idiom \"horse's egg\") which stands for something that does not exist, or is unlikely, impossible, or absurd. This type of idiom is called an idiom of improbability, or 'adynaton', and it is similar to the idiom \"when pigs fly\" in English, or \"Am Sankt-Nimmerleins-Tag\" (on Saint-Never's-day) in German.\n",
    "\n",
    "Python has many idioms that make complex programming easy. Let us look at an example. Suppose you have two variables\n",
    "```python\n",
    "name = 46\n",
    "\n",
    "age = \"Analabha Roy\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, I wanted the variable `name` to contain a string with my name, and the variable `age` to contain an integer with my age. \n",
    "\n",
    "But wait! I made a mistake! The values are switched! So is there a way to switch them back programatically?\n",
    "\n",
    "Doing the obvious operation yields a mistake\n"
