This means that to run a C program, you first have to compile it (e.g., with `gcc`) and _then_ run it; but once you compile the program, you have a standalone executable (e.g., `a.out`). With a Python program, you do not have to compile the program but to _run_ the program you need to run it in the Python interpreter (e.g., `> python hw0.py`)\n","\n","In practice, at least for this class, this distinction will not really matter (it can matter more once you get to long-running programs that operate over large amounts of data).\n","\n","This material is available online at [https://bit.ly/python4c](https://bit.ly/python4c)."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"o5-15j9e7kAm"},"source":["\n","Variables and Types\n","==============\n","\n","Perhaps the biggest difference between C and Python is that C variables are _statically typed_ -- you need to say whether a variable `x` is an `int` or a `float` right up front.
