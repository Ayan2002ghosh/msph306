    "# Introduction to Python and Jupyter Notebooks\n",
    "\n",
    "This lab session entails a very brief introduction to python and Jupyter notebooks. It is assumed that you are already comfortable with the theory material for the MSPH306 course. Some of the content covered during this session was covered briefly during the preceding theory classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Jupyter notebook is an HTML-based notebook environment for Python, similar to Mathematica or Maple. It provides a cell-based environment with great interactivity, where calculations can be organized and documented in a structured way. Jupyter is a loose acronym meaning \"Julia, Python, and R\", three programming languages that are supported by the platform. \n",
    "\n",
    "You can access Jupyter notebooks from the Anaconda Navigator, or directly open the Jupyter Notebook application itself. It should automatically open up in your web browser. \n",

    "## Starting Jupyter \n",
    "\n",
    "If you have not already done so, then begin this lab session by starting the Jupyter application as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Click on the \"Anaconda Navigator\" icon on your desktop. It should look like this: ![Anaconda Navigator Icon](images/anaconda_Icon.png \"Anaconda Navigator Icon\")\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Anaconda Navigator should load. The application should display a window like the one shown below. \n",
    "   \n",
    "   ![Anaconda Navigator](images/nav.png \"Anaconda Navigator\")\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Look for the tile labeled \"Jupyter Notebook\" (circled below) and click the \"Launch\" button.\n",
    "   \n",
    "   ![Jupyter Tile](images/jupyter_tile.png \"Jupyter Tile\")\n",

    "4. The Jupyter notebook interface should load in a browser and look like this\n",
    "\n",
    "   ![Jupyter Start](images/jupyter_start.png \"Jupyter Start\")\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Navigate to the folder named 'msph306' by clicking the link circled above.\n",

    "6. You will see a list of files. The files ending in '.ipynb' are lab notebooks. \n",

    "For example,\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "True, False\n",
    "```\n",
    "are keywords for Boolean expressions. `True` corresponds to the logic bit 1 and `False` to the bit 0. Similarly,\n",
    "```\n",
    "and, or, not\n",
    "```\n",
    "are logical operator keywords. Additionally, `None` represents a null Python object, similar to the null set in set theory. We will explore the usage of some of these keywords throughout this course. The key point is that **these keywords are reserved**, meaning you cannot use them as variable names.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, let’s discuss variables. Variables are names that refer to data. Essentially, they are a way to reference data created by your program in memory. For instance, a Python statement like\n",
    "```python\n",
    "log_one = 0\n",
    "```\n",
    "when executed, causes Python to perform the following actions:\n",
    "1. Create the data, which is an integer with value `0`, and store it in computer memory. \n",
    "2. Create a variable named `log_one` and associate it with the previously created data. \n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, this data is **referenced** by the variable log_one. This reference allows you to access and manipulate the data using the variable name.\n",
    "\n",
    "This reference and its associated data will remain preserved throughout the execution of the program, unless you change the reference, the data that was referenced, or delete the variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "Data can also be **unreferenced**, that is to say, not be associated with any variable. For instance, the python statement\n",
    "```python\n",
    "print(23.5)\n",
    "```\n",
    "when executed, causes Python to perform the following actions:\n",
    "1. Create the data, which is an integer with value `23.5`, and store it in computer memory.\n",
    "2. Pass that data to the `print()` function and display the output\n",
    "\n",
    "Note, however, that no variable was involved. This means that the created data is unreferenced. Python has a **garbage collector** that deletes unreferenced data from memory as it runs through the program. \n",
    "\n",
    "You can delete a variable or re-reference it, for instance\n",
    "```python\n",
    "a = 5\n",
    "b = 10\n",
    "\n",
    "...\n",
    "...\n",
    "\n",
    "del(a)\n",
    "b = 25\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "Let us look at this piece of code carefully.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. In the first line, the integer `5` was prepared in memory and referenced by the variable named `a`.\n",
    "    * Therefore, this data is in a referenced state.\n",
    "2. In the penultimate line, the variable `a` is **deleted** with the `del()` function. \n",
    "    * Note that this `del` is a keyword from the table above! \n",
    "    * This is a built-in function that, when executed, deletes the variable in its argument. In this case, that is `a`.\n",
    "    * Now, the associated data (the integer `5`) has been ***de-referenced*** to an unreferenced state.\n",
    "    * This unreferenced data will be erased from computer memory later. \n",
    "3. In the second line, the integer `10` was prepared in memory and referenced by the variable named `b`. \n",
    "    * Therefore, this data is also in a referenced state.\n",
    "4. However, in the last line, `b` was ***re-referenced*** to newly created data , namely, the integer `25`.\n",
    "    * So the old data (the integer `10`) is now in an unreferenced state.\n",
    "    * This data will **also** be erased from computer memory later. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Rules for creating variables:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Must start with alphabet or an underscore.\n",
    "* Followed by zero or more letters, _ , and digits.\n",
    "* A keyword cannot be used as identifier.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Usage of variables\n",
    "\n",
    "Variables can be used in two ways:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. As arguments to functions or declarations. For instance, the example above:\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "    del(a)\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "   where we supplied the variable `a` as an argument to the `del()` function.\n",
    "2. As **operands** to **operators** in an expression. For instance, the expression \n",
    "    ```python\n",
    "        a = b + c\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "    where the `+` operator is executed with the variables `b` and `c` as operands. The evaluated value (assuming that `b` and `c` are referenced to numbers, then the value is simply their sum) is referenced by the variable `a`. \n",
    "    \n",
    "Let us now try an example code"
