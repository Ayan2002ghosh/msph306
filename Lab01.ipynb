    "# Introduction to Python and Jupyter Notebooks\n",
    "\n",
    "This lab session entails a very brief introduction to python and Jupyter notebooks. It is assumed that you are already comfortable with the theory material for the MSPH306 course. Some of the content covered during this session was covered briefly during the preceding theory classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Jupyter notebook is an HTML-based notebook environment for Python, similar to Mathematica or Maple. It provides a cell-based environment with great interactivity, where calculations can be organized and documented in a structured way. Jupyter is a loose acronym meaning \"Julia, Python, and R\", three programming languages that are supported by the platform. \n",
    "\n",
    "You can access Jupyter notebooks from the Anaconda Navigator, or directly open the Jupyter Notebook application itself. It should automatically open up in your web browser. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Starting Jupyter \n",
    "\n",
    "If you have not already done so, then begin this lab session by starting the Jupyter application as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Click on the \"Anaconda Navigator\" icon on your desktop. It should look like this: ![Anaconda Navigator Icon](images/anaconda_Icon.png \"Anaconda Navigator Icon\")\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Anaconda Navigator should load. The application should display a window like the one shown below. \n",
    "   \n",
    "   ![Anaconda Navigator](images/nav.png \"Anaconda Navigator\")\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Look for the tile labeled \"Jupyter Notebook\" (circled below) and click the \"Launch\" button.\n",
    "   \n",
    "   ![Jupyter Tile](images/jupyter_tile.png \"Jupyter Tile\")\n",
    "\n",
    "4. The Jupyter notebook interface should load in a browser and look like this\n",
    "\n",
    "   ![Jupyter Start](images/jupyter_start.png \"Jupyter Start\")\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Navigate to the folder named 'msph306' by clicking the link circled above.\n",
    "   \n",
    "6. You will see a list of files. The files ending in '.ipynb' are lab notebooks. \n",
    "\n",
    "7. Click on the notebook named 'Lab01.ipynb' to load this notebook into Jupyter. \n",
