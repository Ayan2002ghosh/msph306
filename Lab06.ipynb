    "In the exercise above, we chose a value of $N$ somewhat arbitrarily. We had to choose *some* value, as the real value was infinity, which was impossible to choose computationally. How do we decide a large enough value of $N$, and what will the effect of choosing a value of $N$ that is too small or too large? Too small a choice of $N$, and we lose the influence of higher energy states on the perturbed problem. Too large a choice, and we redundantly add higher energy states that have no perceptible effect on the system. The error that arises out of a choice of finite $N$ is the **truncation error** of the problem.\n",
