For C programmers
=========================
If you have any prior programming experience in C or a similar language like C++ or FORTRAN, you can get a quick overview of python in the notebook linked below:

* [Python for C Programmers](python-for-C-programmers.ipynb)

List of Lab Exercises
=========================

Use the following links:

* [Lab 1: Introduction to Python](Lab01.ipynb)

* [Lab 2: Basic Programming I](Lab02.ipynb)

* [Lab 3: Basic Programming II](Lab03.ipynb)

* [Lab 4: Introduction to NumPy](Lab04.ipynb)

* [Lab 5: Introduction to Matplotlib](Lab05.ipynb)

Additional Notes
=========================

* All requisite software and tools should be installed in the lab computers. If you discover any where they are not, then please contact a lab instructor.

* Not all the computers in the lab are connected to the internet.

* In order to run these exercises locally in your home computer, perform the following steps.
   
  1. Install GitHub Desktop after downloading it from its website @ [desktop.github.com](https://desktop.github.com/)
  2. Then, download this repository by cloning it using GitHub Desktop (see [this doc](https://docs.github.com/en/desktop/contributing-and-collaborating-using-github-desktop/adding-and-cloning-repositories/cloning-a-repository-from-github-to-github-desktop)  for details). The web address of this repository is [https://github.com/hariseldon99/msph306](https://github.com/hariseldon99/msph306)
  3. Finally, download and install the anaconda python distribution (anaconda @ https://www.anaconda.com/). Anaconda includes [Jupyter notebooks](https://jupyter.org/) and the [Spyder IDE](https://www.spyder-ide.org/), either of which can be readily used for designing and running python code. Also, see [this blog entry](https://fangohr.github.io/blog/installation-of-python-spyder-numpy-sympy-scipy-pytest-matplotlib-via-anaconda.html) on how to install anaconda.
