Additional Notes
=========================

* For a quick introduction to the Python programming language, as well as [Numerical Python](https://numpy.org), [Scientific Python](https://scipy.org) and [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org), see [this tutorial](https://cs231n.github.io/python-numpy-tutorial/)

* For a more detailed introduction to the abovementioned topics, see Robert Johansson's [Scientific Python Lectures](https://github.com/jrjohansson/scientific-python-lectures).

* All requisite software and tools should be installed in the lab computers. If you discover any where they are not, then please contact a lab instructor.

* Not all the computers in the lab are connected to the internet.

* In order to run these exercises locally in your home computer, perform the following steps.
   
  1. Install GitHub Desktop after downloading it from its website @ [desktop.github.com](https://desktop.github.com/)
  2. Then, download this repository by cloning it using GitHub Desktop (see [this doc](https://docs.github.com/en/desktop/contributing-and-collaborating-using-github-desktop/adding-and-cloning-repositories/cloning-a-repository-from-github-to-github-desktop)  for details). The web address of this repository is [https://github.com/hariseldon99/msph306](https://github.com/hariseldon99/msph306)
  3. Finally, download and install the anaconda python distribution (anaconda @ https://www.anaconda.com/). Anaconda includes [Jupyter notebooks](https://jupyter.org/) and the [Spyder IDE](https://www.spyder-ide.org/), either of which can be readily used for designing and running python code. Also, see [this blog entry](https://fangohr.github.io/blog/installation-of-python-spyder-numpy-sympy-scipy-pytest-matplotlib-via-anaconda.html) on how to install anaconda.
